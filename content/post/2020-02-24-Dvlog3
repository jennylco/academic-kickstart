# Online Exhibits 

Do online exhibits take away the agency from museums?- Through digitization objects are becoming more accessible. But museums do not have control over how these objects are interpreted if they are displayed through an online exhibit. 

Virtual experience of landmark sites through augmented reality- See how landmark sites have changed over time through VR experience. 

Virtual mapping. Provides the viewer a more interactive experience.

(Samsung VR- Ancient Rome, Myan ruins, exploration, then vs. now.)

Communication is needed between people for the narrative. Decolonialization of objects- how do we deconstruct and rebuild to maintain relationships? Is it possible to be able to step away from this imbedded imperialism?
